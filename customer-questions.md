## Question 1:

*Hello,*

*I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:*
* *Records*
* *Indexing*
 
*I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."*

*Cheers, George*

Hello George. Welcome to Algolia!

I’d be happy to assist you with these concepts as they are important for you to understand as you onboard with us.

**Records** are the single searchable items (products, documents, etc) in your database.  To use an analogy; a *record* would be a single *recipe* entry in a cookbook.  The *ingredients* of that recipe would be the *attributes* of a record.

**Indexing** is the action of creating a database (aka "index") of the records designed for efficient searching. Again with the cookbook analogy; you could browse through the cookbook looking for a recipe that contains ginger (aka "attribute"). However it would be much more efficient to simply reference the cookbook's index and go directly to that page.

We have a great video on [Records and Indexing Basics at Algolia Academy](https://academy.algolia.com/pages/contentcatalog/training/0199aac9-fa35-785f-bdc6-a3191ad0691e/overview)  you may find useful.


**Custom Ranking** allows you to place additional attributes that help influence the ranking order in a result set. Here you have the opportunity to [boost items using business related priority](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/must-do/custom-ranking). Some examples of metrics to use might be based on; an in-house brand, profit margins on a product, or a popularity score like star ratings or number of likes on social media. One point is the attribute values must be either **numbers or true/false**.

I hope this helps and I am happy to arrange a brief chat where we can walk through these concepts in more detail.

Best,

-Dave

## Question 2: 
*Hello,*

*Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.*

*Regards, Matt*

Hello Matt

Thank you for the feedback. All insights are welcome as it helps us to build stronger experiences for everyone and I will take this observation to the Product team.


In the meantime I can offer a few alternatives:

1] Have you considered the Algolia CLI for managing indices directly? https://www.algolia.com/doc/tools/cli/commands/indices/list

2] You might also look into using the Algolia API within your workflow. https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/list-indices

If you’re open to it, we can chat about your workflow and what might be the best options for you?

Best,

-Dave

## Question 3: 

*Hi,*

*I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?*

*Regards, Leo*

Hi Leo. 

Welcome to Algolia! 
I'm happy to give you some direction and clarity here.

Development can be intimidating - but should not be overwhelming. If you are using one (or more) of our partner platforms, there may be ready-made connectors that would jump start the process. 

I will need just a bit more detail in order to provide you with the most efficient path.
Are you available to have a quick chat about your current technical setup and objectives?

Best,

-Dave
